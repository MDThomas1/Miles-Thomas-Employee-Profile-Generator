## Installation
This is a purely command line application and thus will require downloading the code

## Usage
To run the program the first thing to do is go to an integrated terminal and entering node index.js. Once there you will then be sent automatically to creating a profile for your project manager using their name, employee ID, email and office number. Once that is done you will then be asked if you wish to create an engineer, create an intern or end the program. You can continue to create new engineers and interns until you select the option to end the program, which will generate the HTML page and create a card for each created employee.
